### Instructions to download Keras:
Keras is a wrapper library to be used on a backend of either Theano or TensorFlow. To download it, follow the following instructions:

1. One can download either [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html#install) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/get_started/os_setup.html). You can download TensorFlow with this GitHub [link](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow#download-and-setup) as well.
2. After this one can download [Keras](https://keras.io/#installation) by following the instructions on its [site](https://keras.io/).
